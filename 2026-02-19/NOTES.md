- Claude code one year old
	- Anthropic throwing a birthday party this weekend
	- Note that the initial release was a research preview
	- But how has it evolved?
		- It was basic: prompt and code, prompt and code!
		- Crude almost, like that guru developer at the other desk who knows it all. 
			- I always wanted to make a tool named “got”, a sarcastic swiss army knife for your machine
			- Demo “got”
			- Still in heavy development 
	- There was no web search in the initial preview versions
	- Only a default permissions configuration 
- It was eager, still is, all models are eager
- it hardly asked questions
	- Reminds me of the escape driven development that Eugene told about in the last meetup
	- You had to correct it when it went off path
	- But sonnet 3.7 was a good model. 
		- yesterday i had Claude code review a codebase i built with Claude 10 months ago and it made compliments!
		- Trumplang
- Luckily there’s an overview of all its system prompts
	- By a guy who eventually built his own coding agent (which isn’t hard!)
	- You can diff online how it evolved
	- i let Claude itself analyze the changes to its prompts from version one to latest
	- four notable changes are …
- Vibe coding last year was such fun!
	- i built a very nice project i wanted to build since 2016 but for which i just didn’t have the time
		- project sample
	- But…
- the wave of coding agents totally changes the software development process in one year.
	- Because, why are you all here?
	- At first vibe coding, then “vibe code cleaners”, later vibe engineers. Any new names? Agent driven development?
	- Personal software
	- Yet another markdown reader
	- Software as a common commodity
	- X is flooded by just released and the better y etc
	- The real value is in the models and the thin layer on top of them
		- Look after your harness
		- Take time to configure it
			- To tweak it
		- Change it
			- I modified my claude.md recently because Claude code’s system prompt and the models have been changed: less sycophancy for example, more architectural capabilities
		- Diskspace is cheap so set the cache to 99999 or something
			- You might want to get back to your prompts
			- Yes i advocate for saving project state in markdown files as much as possible but sometimes you have this really nice idea in a convo that you want to get back to later. It’s all there. 
	- The age of YA
		- Luckily things change so fast that it won’t last too long
	- I’ve been playing to with all kinds of projects
		- And add i missed the fun and irony lately i made the Bob Ross coding agent
			- Happy little accidents!
		- You can completely rewrite Claude code’s system prompt. 
		- I showed that last meetup where i loaded a writing style guide from 100 years old into Claude code to make it a writing style advisor
- Claude Code grew along with these changes. 
	- More configuration options
	- Moved from cli tool to agent
		- More from that guru perspective to an engineering manager’s perspective 
			- With sub agents
			- Agent swarms (nice metaphor: i should call my machine the beehive)
	- Is this good or bad?
		- Bob Ross never said painting became bad, hebwanted to enjoy it. 
		- It’s a natural process imho
		- Larger user group demands broader feature set
		- It leads to more configuration options! Always a good thing
		- But i’m a builder at heart
			- So i let claude itself merge both the first and the latest system prompt to only cherry pick from the latest one and keep the vibe of the first one. 
			- You can start claude code, since it basically is an agent, with your custom system prompt. This way we have claude code 3.0.0, my personal optimized claude code!
- Coding is still like Lego to me. 
	- I like to build stuff that no-one cares about but me. 
	- I like fiddling, tweaking, playing with the model and see what comes out
	- the toolbox evolved, but so its capabilities 
		- New horizons 
		- An growing option plain
		- Techniques and insights grew
			- which is great!
			- Ralph Wiggum
			- Openclaw
			- Heartbeat
			- Soul
			- Persistence 
			- Optimized system prompts
	- I used sub agents, but i rather build my own
		- It isn’t hard to build your own
- So keep coming to the meetups
	- Let’s keep sharing our learnings
	- This is an invitation to contact is afterwards if you are curious for and willing to present on a next meetup
	- It doesn’t have to be polished
